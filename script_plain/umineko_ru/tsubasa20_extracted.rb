There are many different fragments here.
The catbox is truly bottomless.
Perhaps, if you were to stick your hand inside, you\'d find plenty more.
These are all the fragments I managed to find so far.
If you want more... search for them yourself.
Jump into the catbox, and explore the endless posibilities.
If you\'re ready to search for even more fragments, you can consider yourself my partner.
A Voyager, as witches would say.
Let the Territory Lords sit by the sea and wait for a new fragment to wash ashore.
They aren\'t like us.
We travel the Sea of Fragments in the catbox, finding new fragments that were never discovered by anyone.
But fragments aren\'t the only thing found in this sea.
Sometimes, forgeries created by false authors also drift here.
Some of them are funny, some of them are shocking. 
Some of them are so grand that they make your whole body shudder.
We can gather these kinds of fragments as well. They would never reach the land.
We could even write new forgeries ourselves and throw them into the sea.
If our forgeries were to make it to the land, would the witches waiting there read them?
That idea amuses me.
Some witches seem to enjoy creating forgeries even more than searching for fragments.
This is the end of BEATRICE\'s game board.
But I see that some witches are still waiting in the audience to see more.
Are you one of those waiting at the beach?
Are you a Voyager, or perhaps, a Forger?
Well, I don\'t really care.
But if we could meet again, let us meet here, in the Sea of Fragments.
And for now, I shall take my leave.
Goodbye, Territory Lords.
Goodbye, Voyagers.
Let us meet again, sometime in the future.
