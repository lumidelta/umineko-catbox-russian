After being forced into an unwanted marriage,
Natsuhi developed a grudge against the Ushiromiya family and was filled with a desire for revenge.
(*Trial Summary, p.3)
As revenge for financially ruining her birth family,
Natsuhi also plotted to take over the Ushiromiya family\'s fortune.
(*Trial Summary, p.4)
When Natsuhi learned that the wealth of the Ushiromiya family was for all intents and purposes controlled by Kinzo himself,
she initiated sexual relations to curry favor with him and managed to ensnare him.
(*Trial Summary, p.7)
(*BERNKASTEL Documents, p.682)
To curry favor with Kinzo,
Natsuhi repeatedly disguised herself as BEATRICE, a witch and figment of Kinzo\'s imagination, and engaged in sexual acts.
Kinzo saw Natsuhi dressed as the mistress from his past and was easily ensnared.
Additionally, a servant happened to witness her in this outfit, forming part of the basis for the legend of the witch.

(*BERNKASTEL Documents, p.802)
However, late at night on 1986-10-04, Ushiromiya Battler discovered the hidden gold.
Natsuhi planned the crimes after the relatives raised a fuss and insisted that Battler should succeed the headship.
She murdered the children in the "cousins\' room" and tried to frame Battler for the crime.
Furthermore, Genji was murdered because he was opposed to this scheme.
Later on, Hideyoshi was also murdered.
After this point, Natsuhi displayed a strong intent to murder all those involved without discrimination.
(*Trial Summary, p.27)
(*Supplemental Materials B, p.61)
(*BERNKASTEL Documents, p.1103)
The concrete details of the crimes are as follows:
1986-10-04 24:00.
Natsuhi decided to commit the crimes.
Because Genji refused to assist her when asked, she murdered him.
She then murdered her husband Krauss in his own room.

Afterwards, she went to the "cousins\' room" on the upper floor of the guesthouse,
waited for Rosa to join the rest, and killed George, Jessica, Maria, and Rosa.
She mutilated the necks of the bodies.
Afterwards, because there were people in the downstairs lounge, she waited in an empty room upstairs.
She hid in this empty room until the people in the lounge dispersed and went to bed.
(*Trial Summary, p.41)
(*Supplemental Materials S, p.10)
(*BERNKASTEL Documents, p.1131)
(*Great Court Internal Documents: Library of Law A09 #9974)
The people in the lounge dispersed just after 3 a.m.
Natsuhi left the empty room and escaped from the guesthouse.
She returned to her room, where she met up with Kinzo, who had been hiding there.
They spent the rest of the night there together.
Kinzo left the room early next morning and concealed himself somewhere near the guesthouse.
(*Trial Summary, p.41)
(*Supplemental Materials S, p.29)
(*BERNKASTEL Documents, p.1200)
(*Great Court Internal Documents: Library of Law A09 #9974)
Afterwards, Kinzo saw his chance and carried off the bodies of the six victims one by one, hiding them.
Unfortunately, these hidden bodies have not been found.
(*Trial Summary, p.42)
(*Supplemental Materials S, p.37)
(*Great Court Internal Documents: Library of Law A09 #9974)
Natsuhi, who had failed in her scheme to cast suspicion on Battler, changed her plan to include the murder of all present.
(*Trial Summary, p.58)
(*Supplemental Materials T, p.19)
(*BERNKASTEL Documents, p.1348)
(*Great Court Internal Documents: Library of Law A09 #9974)
Predicting that one of those present would eventually want to take a rest in a private room,
Natsuhi concealed herself inside a closet in one of the guest rooms.
When Hideyoshi visited that room at approximately 13:00, she murdered him.
(*Trial Summary, p.61)
(*Supplemental Materials T, p.26)
(*Great Court Internal Documents: Library of Law A09 #9974)
Natsuhi once again concealed herself in the closet from the time the others became aware of the incident to the time that they carried out Hideyoshi\'s body.
Furthermore, as proof of this, a button from Natsuhi\'s clothes was found in the closet.
Afterwards, she exited the closet and tried to return to her own room.
However, Furudo Erika discovered her on the way, and Natsuhi confessed to her crimes after questioning.

Ushiromiya Natsuhi confessed to the crimes.
For a period of 13 months following this announcement, related documents may be perused at the Great Court Legal Offices Document Management Center, First Subsection.

"Then just say that I did it, okay?!
That\'s what you want me to say, right?!
Waaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhh...!!!"
As though she had given up and decided that it would be useless to try and talk her way out of this any longer,
Aunt Natsuhi said that and screamed.
......It was a sad incident.
I wanted to believe that, despite the pitiable circumstances which led to her marriage into the Ushiromiya family,
......Aunt Natsuhi had been able to find some small measure of happiness with Uncle Krauss and Jessica.
......But instead, by Aunt Natsuhi\'s own hand, Uncle Krauss,
......and even her beloved daughter Jessica,
......had been heartlessly killed...
It was even harder to believe that Grandfather had been an accomplice and hid the bodies...
However, several people had given clear testimony that Grandfather\'s mental state for these last few years...
had been far from what anyone would consider normal.
Perhaps, possessed by a mad devotion to the mistress he had lost long ago,
......Grandfather might truly have believed that Aunt Natsuhi was a reincarnation of BEATRICE.
Where is Grandfather now?
Like Erika theorized,
did he really believe that he could revive BEATRICE by carrying out murders following the epitaph,
and succumb to Natsuhi\'s cajolery?
......Right now, is he holding some kind of disturbing ritual with the bodies he carried away......?
"Are you............
......satisfied now.........?
......This...
...is what you wanted to make me say, right......?"
Aunt Natsuhi sobbed as she spoke.
"......This is...
......your revenge, isn\'t it......?
You, the man from 19 years ago...!!"
This "man from 19 years ago" that Aunt Natsuhi kept mentioning was the man who had supposedly framed her.
However, referring to "a man from 19 years ago" was as far as she would go,
and she made no attempt at all to explain what had actually happened back then...
"I\'m certain......that a pawn of that man is among us now.
......I\'m sure that right now, that man is ridiculing me through one of you..."
".........So tell me...!
Are you happy now?
Has a little of that pain and suffering you\'ve endured for 19 years gone away...?!
.........I finally understand.
...The reason you brought me down to this point......is because......you wanted to make me admit it, isn\'t it......?"
"......Natsuhi-san.
Other than us, there\'s absolutely no one here.
Please stop this insanely desperate charade and quit pretending that someone who doesn\'t exist actually does."
Erika laughed mockingly, but, as Aunt Natsuhi looked at us...
......no, as she looked at some being behind us, ......she hung her head and shook.
Then, .........she confessed to her sin.
"I.........committed murder......"
"So you finally admit your crime directly."
"No,
this is not about what has happened today and yesterday.
.........I confess to a murder that occurred 19 years ago."
The adults all whispered together, wondering what this was about.
......Because they had never heard about a murder case 19 years ago.
"......19 years ago,
......I.........committed a sin.
.........I couldn\'t tolerate it.
......That.........baby...!!"
"Baby?
Now what are you talking about?"
"......On that day 19 years ago,
...Father entrusted me with a baby.
.........Since I was having so much trouble conceiving a successor, Father told me to adopt a child,
......and he brought me a baby which he said was from a welfare institute......and he put it in my arms..."
"Do you have any idea......how humiliating that was to me as a woman...?!"
With a mix of conflicting emotions, of anger, sadness, regret and possibly defiance,
Aunt Natsuhi confessed.
The humiliation as a woman that others had given up hope on her ever bearing a child.
And also, the indescribably unpleasant feeling of being made to nurse a strange baby.
It caused her great sadness and rage,
and before very many nights passed, it ate a hole into her heart......
And then, ......I sold my soul.........to demons...
.........It happened when I went on a walk through the rose garden to the harbor, along with a servant holding the baby...
......I wanted to be alone,
......but that servant woman holding the baby faithfully followed me everywhere.
I was unable even to tell her to stop following me, ......and therefore unable to escape from the child\'s crying......
.........That day...
marked the beginning of 19 long, headache-filled years......
.........Then, we were by the fence overlooking the cliff.
If by taking that baby...
...and throwing it down onto the rocky beach far below me,
......I could make all this go away...
......I really did hear that demonic temptation in my ear.
And.........for the smallest of moments, I thought of how wonderful it would be if I really could do that,
......and lent an ear to that temptation.
......And that was when - 
The servant holding the baby stepped on a large rock, twisted her ankle, and staggered......
She leaned against the rough fence, ......and at that moment, I thought I heard the fence creak loudly.
I told her to look out and went to grab her shoulder.
......No,
......I shouldn\'t be so vague...
I\'ll repent.
I\'ll confess.
.........At that moment, I\'m sure that......as I told her to look out,
............with both hands,
I reached for that servant\'s shoulders,
and with a thud,
......I pushed her away hard......
The rough fence snapped from the base,
.........and the servant,
......along with the baby held in her arms,
.........fell down towards the rocky beach below......
Even though...
...I remember that moment vividly,
...for some reason I recall a vague...
...and very strange feeling.
It almost felt as though instead of falling,
......the two of them were silently swallowed up into empty space.
So I never even heard the sound of them crashing to the rocky beach.
No, I must have heard it.
But because I wanted to think that they\'d simply disappeared,
......I must have erased that sound from my memory...
".........A-.........and then.........?"
"For an instant, ...I thought it was a dream.
......It was high enough that I couldn\'t see the two of them below me just by leaning over.
So I couldn\'t tell whether their fall, ......the events of just a few seconds earlier, had actually happened or not..."
I must have been wishing so strongly that the child would fall from there...
that I hallucinated the whole thing...
Trying to make myself believe this, I hurried back to the rose garden.
......I decided to say that I\'d left the baby with the servant and had been taking a rest alone in the garden...
......Then,
.........Father asked what had happened to the baby,
............
.........which caused a stir over the disappearance of the servant...
......who I\'d left the baby with.........
Eventually, the broken fence was discovered,
.........and the two corpses were found at the bottom of the cliff...
......The baby\'s origins apparently couldn\'t be made known, so its existence was hushed up,
......and the official story was that the servant simply died in an accident alone.
That\'s right.
I......stole away two innocent lives in one go.........
As for the poor servant......her family was generously compensated.
This was enough to satisfy her aged husband, who grieved over the unfortunate accident - he never knew the truth.
Then, just a few years ago, he died of old age, .........and I confessed the truth over his grave, apologizing.
".........But to this day...
......I have never apologized to that baby.
......Yes,
.........that\'s what you\'re after, isn\'t it......?"
"So right here, right now, I\'ll confess to my crime!
......I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi,
.........did 19 years ago...
......push you off a cliff...
...and try to kill you......"
......But...
......you didn\'t die after all......
.........You\'re still alive,
......and you still call me "Mother"...
.........You came to this island,
.........and took your revenge on me, didn\'t you......?
When you learned...
......that you were pushed off a cliff by the woman you should have been calling a mother for the past 19 years,
......you must have lived a life so full of hatred...
"......And now, ......you\'ve taken everything I\'ve gained since pushing you off that cliff,
18 years of my life, ......and smashed it all to pieces...
......I no longer have my beloved husband or daughter.
......And I\'ve lost even my honor,
......and am being called a murderer...
.........No, ......I really am a murderer, aren\'t I......"
"Yes, that\'s right.
......It all went according to your plans.
......I\'m now regarded as a killer..."
"...............How is this for you...?
Is this enough...
...for your revenge......?"
"My husband and daughter have been killed!!
......I\'ve been made to look like a murderer......like an adulteress even......
After seeing me put through such terrible humiliation,
............are you satisfied......?!"
"Yes, I\'ll bet you\'re quite satisfied...
......Because my family...
...my honor...
......everything.........has been taken from me......
......Uuughuu...
...*hic*......
uuuuughhuuhhuuu!!"
".........After all this, you still claim that you were framed?
Seriously, you just don\'t know when to give up."
"Can you hear me?! You, the cursed baby from 19 years ago...!!
Are you satisfied now?!
You\'ve taken everything from me!!
What more do you want?!
......Please,
......just...
......forgive me............"
"......No good."
"Huh.........?"
".........Battler-san,
did you say something?"
"No good at all."
".........B-
.........Battler......ku......n......?"
".........Yeah.
...It\'s no good...
It\'s no goddamn good at all......"
"Ah......
.........aaahhhh...............!!"
